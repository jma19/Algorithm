Dynamic Programming (DP), like the divide and conquer method, solves problems by combining the solutions to  subproblems. DP applies when the subproblems overlaps. It only sloves each subproblems just once and saves its answer in a table, thereby avoiding the  work of recomputing the answer every time it solves each subsubproblem.
